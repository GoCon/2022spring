I'm an Open Source and software development enthusiast. I love writing code and contribute to Open Source project, and I have the privilege of being one of the starters or contributors in some interesting Open Source projects like Taiga, Penpot, Mattermost or Focalboard. I'm a big fan of learning new things, specially programming languages. I love Rust, Go, Python and Clojure, and love to deep dive into technical details.

Currently I'm working mainly in Go and Typescript in Mattermost, and I keep trying to contribute to open source project whenever I can.
