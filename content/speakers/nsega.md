Software Engineer. I have mainly developed the service with GCP, Go, and Kubernetes. I will challenge new things I have never experienced to create good products based on the technology(cloud-native app, microservices). I am eager to keep trying the new challenge and more responsibility because I can contribute more to grow good products. My hobby is scuba diving. My favorite motto is "Do or do not, there is no 'try.'", the master Yoda quote.
